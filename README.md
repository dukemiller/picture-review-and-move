# picture-review-and-move

Display the images in a folder, then press enter to move the current displayed image or arrow keys to navigate through the directory. A small tool I made in about an hour to go through images one by one and move them without having to go back to the shell / explorer. Latest release [can be downloaded here.](https://github.com/dukemiller/picture-review-and-move/releases/latest)

**How to use:**  
Put a directory path in image directory textbox. If it exists and there are images in it, it will load up the first image in the folder. For **navigation**, use the **right arrow and left arrow keys** to move forward and backward. Press **enter** to move the current image to the output directory if it exists.

A small example of me moving the pictures of flowers out of the birds folder as soon as I see them.
